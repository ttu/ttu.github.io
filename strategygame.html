	<li>This project was about learning game architecture, so tried to do everything myself from the beginning.</li>
	<li>Update after few months: Have to admit that making working physics takes too much time, so have to find so ready made solution.</li>
	<li>Update: This project is now on break (indifinitely). Next step is concurrency.</li>
	<br/>
	
	<li>Style: medieval / fantasy boardgame look with pretty simple rules (like Warhammer etc.).</li>
	<li>Game is in real-time and user can stop time to give commands to units.</li>
	<li>UI is separated from Game Engine, so engine works with WinForms and XNA (XNA.Game replaces Game-class).</li>

	Notes:<br/>
	<pre>
	UI
	- User Interface
	Game
		- Main loop
	StateManager
		- Keep track in what state game is
	State
		- Game bahaviour logic
		- Decide what to do when updating and with inputs
		Init
			- Load all objects
		GameState
			- Game is running
		Pause
			- User can view map and give commands to GameObjects (kind of a command state).
			- Move- and FightComponents are not called, so game is running but any movement or fighting is not happening.
		End
			- Show statistics
	InputManager
		- Handle Input Queue
		- Execute InputActions
	InputAction
		- Move Camera, Zoom, Select etc.
		- DoAction does all the action
	ObjectManager
		- Creates and handles all GameObjects
		QuadTree
			- Keeps track of object locations
		GameObject
			- Objects you can see in the UI
				- Includes blocking objects, like houses, walls and trees.
			- Can be loaded with functionality using Components
				- Objects are not is-a, but has-a
				MovementComponent
				AttackComponent
				BehaviorComponent
					- What will AI character do
			Item
				- Objects Characters can use (weapons, armor etc.)
	CameraSystem
		- Keeps track of coordinates of what is shown in window
	GameArea
		- Info of full map
		
	----------------------------------------------------
	On UserInput current state checks if input is allowed in this state and InputManager adds inputs to queues and returns those to State at Update.
	
	User can zoom in/out camera. Game will only draw object on view (using QuadTree).
	
	QuadTree is also used to check collisions and when calculating routes to target.
