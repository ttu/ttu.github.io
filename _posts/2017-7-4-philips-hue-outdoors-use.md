3 bulbs were installed 23.7.2016 and 4 bulbs 31.7.2016. Only 1 bulp is in sealed lamp and that one didn't work out so well as it has had some humidity inside it since October 2016.

Lights are automatized with [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com). Lights turn on at sunset and turn off at sunrise. IFTTT fetches sunset and sunrise times from _weather.com_. On darkest time lights are on 18 hours and on lightest time 5 hours in a day ([Sun Graph for Helsinki](https://www.timeanddate.com/sun/finland/helsinki)).

(__07/2017__) There has been ~3 days when lights didn't turn on automatically when IFTTT was updating Hue integration and maybe 5 times when lights didn't turn on or off for unknown reason (problems with wifi etc.). Based on my experiences IFTTT's reliability is pretty good.

(__08/2017__) The bulb that was in a sealed lamp which had gathered humidity for since 10/2016 finally malfunctioned. Sealed case had like 50ml of water inside and lots of moisture. Considering that, I would say that Hue bulbs work well in moist conditions.

(__09/2017__) New bulb was installed in a new sealed lamp which has a proper IP rating for outdoors.
