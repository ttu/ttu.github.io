# Intro

Historically, larger companies have emulated trends originating from the US west-coast based software companies and from the startup scene, where innovative teams excel at delivering new functionality at an accelerated pace.

However, this often results in a selective approach, where organizations cherry-pick elements that align with their existing processes and overlook the broader context of these innovations.  For example,

* __Agile:__ Companies may adopt Agile methodology without changing their organizational culture or structure. They still rely on rigid hierarchies, siloed teams, and top-down decision making. This contradicts the Agile principles of collaboration, self-organization, and customer feedback.
* __Scrum:__ Some companies treat Scrum as a set of rules and rituals, rather than a flexible and adaptive approach. Focus is on following the Scrum ceremonies and artifacts, rather than delivering value and quality to the customers.
* __Lean Startup:__ While applying Lean Startup principles, companies keep on building products based on their own vision and intuition, rather than on customer feedback and data. This approach often leads to launching products without the Lean Startup's essential cycles of experimentation and outcome measurement.
* __Kanban:__ Companies might implement Kanban systems but fail to review or update these systems with the necessary regularity, neglecting the essential feedback loops and continuous improvement that Kanban facilitates.
* __Product Teams:__ Although companies may establish product teams with the intent that these teams are empowered to make decisions and transform problems into functional solutions with autonomy, the reality often falls short, with teams operating as little more than renamed feature teams.
* __Objectives and Key Results (OKRs):__ Organizations may adopt OKRs with the goal of motivating and guiding teams. However, OKRs are sometimes assigned without sufficient team input or discussion about direction, using key results solely as a metric for measuring team performance rather than as a dynamic tool for driving progress. 

Often there is a reason for this selected approach and as engineers we must understand that we do not have the whole context behind decisions, and we must try to make processes work best with the given constraints.

Naturally, there are successful companies that do not follow any specific practices yet continue to deliver successful products. Projects are completed based on the best knowledge available, as the people within the company are well-informed and skilled. Of course, all of this varies with the complexity of the product and the expertise of the individuals working in the company.

__TLDR;__

* Teams should be self-sufficient problem solvers, not simply producing features
  * Teams should possess all necessary expertise (PO, Design, Analytics, Engineers) to tackle problems from concept to launch.
  * Engineers should adopt a product-oriented mindset, understanding the broader impact of their work
* Prioritize rapid delivery to gather feedback and start learning as soon as possible
  * Teams should have the autonomy to deliver complete features without relying on external support
  * External stakeholders should be actively involved in weekly team discussions to align expectations
* Prioritize effectiveness over features. Swiftly eliminate or refine ideas that fail to deliver value
  * No need to waste time on features that do not bring value
* Being effective requires a cultural shift and a shift in mindset from top to bottom
  * Establishing trust is crucial for this approach to succeed
  * The company must trust the product teams, and the teams must earn that trust through their actions
* Individuals are capable of revising their opinions and guiding their decisions towards the company's benefit
  * People are flexible in their viewpoints and prioritize the company's benefit
* Employees are dedicated and willing to consistently give their full effort
* Companies should see technology as an important enabler
  * Engineering is not a cost center, but an important stakeholder for the business
  * Engineer understands that technology is just a tool for solving business problems
* Always deliver value

# Books behind theories

Key theories behind the current trends can be found from multiple different sources and books. In this summary we use as examples mainly theories from "The Goal" and "Empowered". 

__The Goal__ - How to optimize process to reach the goal

![The Goal](/images/posts/process-optimization/the-goal-cover.png){: width="200" }

__Empowered__ - Guide to creating successful Product (domain) Teams

![Empowered](/images/posts/process-optimization/empowered-cover.png){: width="200" }

"The Goal" shares the same overall principles as Toyota Production System and Lean

![Toyota Production System](/images/posts/process-optimization/toyota-lean-covers.png){: width="800" }

and System Thinking

![Systems Thinking](/images/posts/process-optimization/systems-thinking-covers.png){: width="800" }

## Commonalities in The Goal, Toyota Production System and Lean

Focus on eliminating waste:
  * Non-value-added activities are waste.
  * Different waste categories: e.g. overproduction, inventory, waiting time, transportation, processing, and rework.

Emphasis on the flow of work:
  * Smooth and uninterrupted flow of work through the production process.

Continuous improvement:
  * Culture of continuous improvement, where employees are encouraged to identify and address problems and inefficiencies.

## Systems Thinking

Systems thinking is a holistic approach to analysis that focuses on the way that a system's constituent parts interrelate and how systems work over the time and within the context of larger systems.

Understand the system as a whole:
  * How all processes interact with each other. Systems are made up of interacting parts, and changes in one part can have ripple effects throughout the system.

Constraints and bottlenecks limit the overall performance:
  * Identification and management of constraints are essential for achieving optimal system performance. By understanding the constraints that are limiting a system, we can develop strategies to improve efficiency, reduce waste, and achieve our desired outcomes.

Common with most management practices:
* Emphasize the importance of creating value for customers, identifying and eliminating waste, and continuously improving processes

Best practices are a compilation of effective methods from various sources.

## Empowerment and product minded engineers

The recognition of the value of empowering people and product-focused engineers is not a recent development either.

aka best employees focus on what is important and get things done

(balance between "get things done"-mentality and build something that is maintainable)

# The Goal

Published 1984

> The Goal emphasizes the importance of identifying and overcoming bottlenecks to achieve operational efficiency and business success

Letâ€™s start with background theory from The Goal. The Goal is "oldie but goldie", like are the most things in IT and business.

The Goal is written as entertaining novel as Goldratt though that management books are too boring to read. If 300+ pages fictional novel is still too long, The Goal is also available as a comic book, which is extremely fast to read.

![The Goal comic book](/images/posts/process-optimization/the-goal-comic-cover.png){: width="200" }

There is also a good book from IT perspective, The Phoenix Project, which is kind of homage to The Goal. The Phoenix Project shows that the same principles that EM Goldratt showed originally for manufacturing in The Goal could be used to improve technological processes as well.

Read list for engineers:
1. "The Goal"-comic
2. "The Phoenix Project"-book

## Briefly about the main theory of "The Goal"

__The Theory of Constraints__ (__TOC__) is a management philosophy that focuses on identifying and managing constraints within a system to achieve overall improvement.

The core idea is that every complex system, whether it's a manufacturing process or a business operation, __has bottlenecks or constraints that limit its overall performance__.

## The Goal & key measurements of operational performance

The goal of a company is ultimately always to make money. This is a good thing to keep in mind. If a company doesn't make money, it will cease to exist. 

> If a company doesn't make any profit, it is likely that there will be no work for its employees in the future.

## 4 measures: Goal, Throughput, Inventory and Operational Expenses

These four measures are used to assess the overall health and performance of a system. By understanding how they interact, employees can make informed decisions that will help the company achieve its goals. These examples are from manufacturing.

* Goal 
  * Make money through sales
* Throughput
  * Products sold to the customer
  * NOTE: Not product manufactured, but sold
* Inventory
  * Products in production or waiting to be sold
  * Materials for production etc.
  * Includes employee waiting time and unused potential from work
* Operational Expenses
  * All expenses related to creating inventory and creating throughput from inventory

![The Goal - 4 measures](/images/posts/process-optimization/the-goal-4-measures.png){: width="400" }

The goal is to maximize throughput while minimizing the inventory and operational expenses.

### Key components in Software Development

Key components transferred from company perspective to software development:
* Goal
  * Deliver new and enhanced features that create value for both the business and the customer
* Throughput
  * Features successfully delivered
* Inventory
  * Includes both work in progress, work on hold and tasks awaiting release, as well as all plans, designs etc. for which implementation work has not yet commenced
* Operational expenses
  * All expenses related to creating inventory and creating throughput from inventory

__Key takeaways:__ Delivered and value created. Nothing else matters. 
* If the feature is not in use, it is worthless. 
* If the feature doesn't create value for the business, it is worthless.

### How to achieve operational efficiency?

The goal is to maximize throughput while minimizing the inventory and operational expenses.

![The Goal - Achieve operational efficiency](/images/posts/process-optimization/the-goal-achieve-operational-efficiency.png){: width="400" }

__The Goal:__ Increase throughput while simultaneously reducing both inventory and operating expenses.


* Increase throughput
  * Make sure that everything is deployed as fast as possible. No gatekeepers, e.g. long QA, architecture board, security board etc.
* Reduce inventory
  * Take features immediately to production. 
  * Work on a few features at a time. From planning to delivery.
* Reduce operational expenses
  * Reduce manual work, reduce unnecessary work that blocks development.
  * Do not work on features before we are ready to take those into production. 
* Reduce inventory and operational expenses
  * Go live as fast as possible and stop working on features that do not bring value.

Focus on lead time:
* How long does it take to go from decision to start to work on feature to get it live in production?
* Eliminate non-value-added activities and improve flow of work.

## Example

Simplified example that highlights the idea.

3 employees, 3 features. Each feature will take 4 (mythical) man months to complete.

![Process- Example 1](/images/posts/process-optimization/process-example-1.png){: width="300" }

Each month an employee works on 1 part of the feature. During the 4-month period work in progress grows, which will be counted as an inventory. When all are completed and delivered. Throughput is not constant.

![Process - Example 2](/images/posts/process-optimization/process-example-2.png){: width="800" }

If employees work as a team and focus on 1 feature at a time, inventory can be kept smaller, and throughput is more constant flow.

![Process - Example 3](/images/posts/process-optimization/process-example-3.png){: width="800" }

Features start to bring value from the 2nd month. Iteration and validation can also start immediately when the feature is live.

### Traditional steps of development process

![Traditional steps](/images/posts/process-optimization/process-traditional-steps.png){: width="1000" }

Multiple steps in the process can lead to inventory buildup and delays in delivery if there are any disruptions or delays in those steps. Every completed step is counted as inventory, except for already delivered features (orange & green).

### Optimized product team setup with an optimal process for Empowered teams

Brief Explanation: Further details on teams and processes will be discussed later in the article.

![Optimized steps](/images/posts/process-optimization/process-optimized-steps.png){: width="400" }

The team selects a few topics from the discovery phase to work on during the quarter.
* Discovery is a phase where a company identifies customer- and business problems to address. This is a continuous process.
* Delivery (quarterly, sprints, agile etc.) includes all required steps from traditional process, with all work being managed by the team during the development process. The key difference is that all work should be completed from start to finish without interruptions, focusing on as few features as possible. 

Goal is to 
* Do everything as late as possible (Just-In-Time)
* Optimize process steps that require manual or acceptance work before going live, after the implementation is complete.
* Ensure the team possesses all necessary skills and capabilities to work from discovery through to bringing the feature into production.
* Lock in topics before the quarter/iteration or once implementation work begins, avoiding any changes in prioritization during implementation. The team should maintain a strong focus on selected topics.
  * If there's a need to shift priorities, it must be justified exceptionally well, as the cost is typically very high.
    * Justifications should include the reason, the impact of the new feature, a consultation with engineers on the time required, and a rationale for why it can't wait.
    * If the product team is truly empowered, the individual requesting the change must convince the team of its necessity.
* Aim to go live as quickly as possible. The MVP (Minimum Viable Product) should truly be a minimal product.

Minimize inventory, e.g. plans and designs that are not going to be worked on soon
* There is a risk that some of the features will be killed before production or that a large feature, once live, does not create value. 
* In both scenarios, the feature and the effort used can be categorized as waste.
* Plan only when work is started
  * Initial planning
  * Design / Develop
  * (optional Release)
  * Plan
  * Design / Develop
  * (optional Release)
  * Plan
  * ...and so on

## Other interesting topics from process optimization

1. Identifying and fixing bottlenecks
2. Constant flow vs batch processing
3. Using data to understand the process and in decision making

### Identifying and fixing bottlenecks
Bottlenecks are a natural part of any process and will always exist. It is therefore important to have a clear understanding of the entire process and to visualize it to identify and address bottlenecks.

Bottleneck is any step, resource, or activity that prevents the process from achieving its desired outcome. It could be a particular task that takes too long to complete, a lack of capacity, or a communication breakdown. Any factor that slows down the overall flow of work and prevents the process from reaching its target performance is considered a bottleneck.

Bottlenecks
* Resources capacity is less than demand placed on them
Non-bottlenecks
* Resources capacity is more than demand placed on them

![Bottleneck](/images/posts/process-optimization/bottleneck.png){: width="600" }

Buffer in front of bottleneck. Define correct amount.

![Buffer](/images/posts/process-optimization/bottleneck-buffer.png){: width="600" }

In any system only the bottleneck should be 100% utilized. Keep non-bottlenecks open for important not fill with un-important work, so they won't slow down the bottleneck.

Once a bottleneck has been identified, it's crucial to understand the underlying cause. Based on the root cause analysis, develop targeted solutions to address the bottleneck. This could involve optimizing resource allocation, improving process steps, automating tasks, or introducing technology solutions. Monitor the situation after the solution has been implemented. Fixing the bottleneck is not a one-off effort, continuously evaluate and improve solution. 

In software development, due to the variability in task durations, it's challenging to predict bottlenecks upfront. This makes capacity planning more difficult.  Product teams address this with multi role team members, single team member can do planning, design, development, testing etc.

### How to understand the significance and cost of each step of the process?

The cost of each step should be measured by carrying costs. If deploying to production is a manual step, cost is not just labor cost of that employee, but it is blocking features from being used, so actually cost is whole development cost.

_(TODO: Check formula)_

Releasing a feature takes 2 hours. The cost is 50e per hour. Previous steps have been taken in total 300 hours with same hourly cost. 

_TODO: something about these?_
Dependent events, that must happen before
Statistical fluctuations

### Not from "The Goal": Kanban

Kanban is a familiar tool for many software engineers. 

Kanban is a lean management methodology that uses visual cues to manage workflow and inventory. It is a pull system, which means that work is pulled through the system as needed.

Kanban board with work-in-progress (WIP) limits

![Kanban with WIP limits](/images/posts/process-optimization/kanban-wip-limits.png){: width="600" }

Kanban board with done sections to help with pulling the ready to be worked

![Kanban board don with done sections](/images/posts/process-optimization/kanban-done-sections.png){: width="800" }

1. WIP limits are important as they identify potential bottlenecks in the process and restrict the amount of parallel work.
2. Unfortunately, WIP limits are frequently disregarded.
3. It is common for teams to employ a board to monitor progress and claim to be using Kanban, when they simply have a board.

## Flow vs Batch processing

Based on (all) management theories, constant flow is better than batch flow. Benefits are slightly different in manufacturing than in software development, but the same principles apply for both fields.

Benefits:
* Limitations in the process and bottlenecks easier to identify
* Work is released to production all the time
* Reduce inventory as there are no large batches waiting for processing
* Reduce investment in materials
* Improve cash flow

In software, reduction in materials or cash flow is not significant, but constant flow enables us to respond to changes faster (not doing wrong things, deliver fast, agile).

### Realities of perfectly balanced process and 100% efficiency

Striving for 100% efficiency is not always the most effective approach. While it may seem like a goal to strive for, it can sometimes lead to inefficiencies in other areas of the process. For example, it's important to allow time to address issues that arise beyond the focused delivery process.

A perfectly balanced process, characterized by just-in-time (JIT) operations, minimized inventory, and efficient employee utilization, can optimize cash flow and efficiency. However, this very tightness of the system also exposes the company to greater risks from disruptions, which could potentially lead to bankruptcy.

### JIT (just in time)

Pandemic is a good example of what problems can happen with JIT, when there are e.g. disruptions in the supply chain.

![JIT](/images/posts/process-optimization/jit.png){: width="800" }

* Customer wants a product 
  * Shops waiting for products 
    * Product manufacturers waiting for parts 
      * Part manufacturers waiting for raw materials
        * Raw material production has delays

Disruptions in a single step can slow down the whole process. This happens especially if there are no optimal buffers or inventories in place.

### AOT (ahead of time)

AOT is not without problems either as it can be hard to predict the future.

Changes in demand -> Too large inventory

Customer behavior can change fast. Company is left with a large inventory or feature that has been in development for years becomes obsolete in a single night as competitors release something that customers want.

## Utilizing Data to Understand Processes and Make Decisions

Utilizing data effectively is crucial for understanding, identifying, and resolving process issues, as well as for making strategic decisions that are informed by a comprehensive view of the entire production system. To efficiently harness data, certain prerequisites must be met:
* Data must be accurate.
* Data should be gathered from diverse sources.
* The relationships within the data must be understood.
* Skills in data analysis are essential.
* Data must inform and drive action.

Looking closely at the right data helps us figure out where we need to make improvements. If we use the wrong numbers to guide us, we might miss bigger problems. We should look at the whole picture, not just small parts of it. Good data is important for making decisions and for keeping an eye on how things are going. For example:
* API requests
  * Responses were fast, but all responses had empty payloads.
  * Responses were fast, but all were errors. Monitoring didn't care about status code.
* Send rate
  * Example of following a success rate of sent emails. The success rate was high, but the system didn't handle emails to a single country.
* Conversion rate
  * Increase one conversion but decrease the other at the same time. No guard metrics in use.
* A/B testing
  * Missing data from collected metrics. Wrong conclusions.

Companies ought to cultivate a culture that is driven by data. This culture promotes the appreciation and use of data by employees in their everyday tasks, resulting in a better-informed and more analytical way of solving problems and making decisions.
