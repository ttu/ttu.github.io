title: Mountain biking skill guides
excerpt: Collection of guides, tips and tricks to learn some mtb skills.
---

Compilation of mtb skills guides that I've found useful over the years. These basic and advanced skills will enhance the enjoyment on trails and on downhill routes.

Mountain (or trail) biking is not easy. Even with a cycling background, it can take a while to get used to the difficult terrain as required skills are quite different than on the road.

A good example of difficulty is shown in this video, where former professional road cyclists try out mountain biking for the first time is. It is not easy for them either.

Good guidance is to start with simple steps. Complexity is the enemy of the execution. When first simple actions come automatically without thinking too much, add next steps. If I try to execute too many new steps, everything will break apart. 

<h2>Pedal and body position</h2>

Heels down and ass back is a pretty good first advice. These guides recommend that it might be actually easier to keep a good position while having front heel down and back heel up.

<h2>How to get off and on steep sections</h2>

How to dismount on a steep section of the trail is a lifesaver and reduces the amount of panic.

After dismounting it is also good to learn how to resume, so then there is no need to always walk down.

<h2>Get over an obstacle</h2>

Getting over an obstacle doesn't require any advanced bunny hop technique. Basically lift the front wheel on top of the logde and lift the back wheel up. Speed is required as back wheel will need to land at least on top of the lodge.

<h2>Pedal kick</h2>

Good technique to get on top of the obstacle.

More instructions on how to get more power to that kick.

<h2>Drops with speed</h2>

Small drops are common on trails. It is easy enough to learn the basic skills and gain some confidence, so drops won't stop the good flow.

Find some small stairs etc. from a school ground or any drop from children playground. Even 20cm drop or even just a curb is a good first step.

[image where I started]

1. Have enough speed
2. Take weight off from front tyre just before the edge

You need to get weight off from the front tyre. Don't pull the bar with your arms, but move your weight back. Pull to the handlebar comes automatically from the body movement. You can also help by pulling with arms, but it is good to move whole body.

When approaching the drop, you need to have enough speed that when you take the weight off from the front tire, back tire will go over the lip before front tire start to go down.

Great! This is already pretty close to jumping as your both tires are in the air!

<h2>Jumping</h2>

Jumping is extremely complicated topic… Learn manual, learn bunnyhop, learn xxx and after that you can learn jumping.

Naturally it is good to master these techniques, but unfortunately most of us don't have skill or enough time to train that much.

But what skills you really need to start from small jumps?

In reality, it is also possible to start little differently. Even kids jump with bikes without perfect manual or bunnyhop skills, so you can learn to be ok-ish with jumps event without those skills.

1. Enough speed
2. Good posture
3. Relax

This takes you already far and you can pretty much enjoy any jump for the "normal" people.

When jumpst start to get bigger there is a big chance for so called "dead-sailor". To keep you occupied you can do a rowing motion in the air. Push bars forward and bend legs. Keep looking far ahead. Bar turn is also a good option to keep you occupied.

There are many steps to do. Mostly I have noticed that when I start to do too many things, everything breaks down and I can't do even most simple jumps nicely.

<h2>Steep jumps</h2>

Steep jumps, e.g. dirt jumps.

1. Keep knees over the toes and body perpendicular to sea level (stand up straight all the time)

<h2>Bunny hop</h2>

Proper bunny hop is freaking hard. I know how to hop up the front and the rear at the same time, but doing a proper bunny hop seems to be an impossible feat.

I recommend to try a simplified version from this video:

<iframe width="100%" height="350" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mGcWNy8oZmo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

For me this one worked like a charm. Not a proper bunny hop, but now I can jump over small obstacles or get a little extra air from drops.

Maybe some day I will magically learn the true bunny hop. Maybe.

<h2>Manual</h2>

1. Find courage to go low and back enough
1. Knees should point outwards
1. Do not be afraid to go over
1. More courage to go even lower and back

Maybe will manage this some day. I have managed few times to get to a correct position and you can really feel it when you are in a correct manual position.

<h2>Wheelie</h2>

Normal wheelie is a nice trick. "Power" wheelie required by drops is actually an useful wheelie.

1. Dont yank arms. Pull should come from the body movement
2. Seat up and low gear

Rear brake is your friend and will save you if you are going to go over.

<h2>Drops with a slow speed / power wheelie</h2>

Extremely nice skill on trails. Brings lots of extra fun. 

1. 2 pedals strokes is good enough
2. Small gear
3. Start from curbs. Then to 20cm drop and progress on

Good way to practice is a mental practice. Look a mark on the ground and imagine that as the start of the drop.

Some people apparently think the motion as a pedal kick instead of wheelie. Half pedal kick technique "tutorial" start at ~3:00. Power wheelie mindset is easier for me, but main things is to find what works for you.

<h2>Riding Berms</h2>

Start simple. Less things to think better.

Keep the pedals flat. Less things to think while approaching the corner. Keep peadals always flat and keep same feet in the front.

1. Break before the corner
2. Don't break during cornering (or use rear brake only lightly to prevent speeding up too much)
3. Keep eyes on exit
4. Come in high, exit low
5. Lean more towards to exit (attack the exit). Turn hips towards exit
6. Push inside arm, outside arm bracing, elbow up
7. Pump into the berm

Interseting part of this was, that I actually had the realization that you do not need to steer the bike with handlebars/arms, but you can steer with hips.

<h2>Bar turn</h2>

Start with extemely small movement. To make things easier, turn handlebar towards where you are watching or where you want to turn bike next.

<h2>Whip</h2>

Small whip comes with a bar turn. Don't worry if back wheel is not completely staight when landing.
