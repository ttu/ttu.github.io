#### How to write good code

Hard to find a single good book to recommend. It is good to keep in mind that books have always author's personal opinions and you do not need to agree with them all. Overall, following practices will help you to write better code.

Start with one of these:
[JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) | [TypeScript](https://github.com/labs42io/clean-code-typescript) | [Python](https://github.com/zedr/clean-code-python)

and read more from books

* [The Art of Readable Code](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8677004-the-art-of-readable-code)
  * More approachable and lightweight than _Clean Code_ or _Refactoring_

* [Refactoring](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44936.Refactoring)

After that, write more code. And repeat, repeat and repeat.

  * In some companies engineering is not a feature factory. Engineers are expected to be creative problem solvers who also understand the business.
* [Why coding isn't enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzhnRt6ZDKM)
  * _"The job of a software engineer is not to code, at least not 100% of it is; it's to solve a technical problem. So have pride in solving that problem."_
