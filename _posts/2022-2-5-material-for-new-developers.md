#### How to write good code

Hard to find a single good book to recommend. It is good to keep in mind that books have always author's personal opinions and you do not need to agree with them all. Overall, following practices will help you to write better code.

Start with one of these:
[JavaScript](https://github.com/ryanmcdermott/clean-code-javascript) | [TypeScript](https://github.com/labs42io/clean-code-typescript) | [Python](https://github.com/zedr/clean-code-python)

and read more from books

  * 2nd edition has code examples in JavaScript
* [Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759-philosophy-of-software-design)
  * How to design software while avoiding complexity

After that, write more code. And repeat, repeat and repeat.

#### About engineering and product development

* [Why coding isn't enough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzhnRt6ZDKM)
  * _"The job of a software engineer is not to code, at least not 100% of it is; it's to solve a technical problem. So have pride in solving that problem."_
* [Things they didn’t teach you about Software Engineering](https://vadimkravcenko.com/shorts/things-they-didnt-teach-you/)
  * Some important aspects of software engineering that are often overlooked in traditional education, e.g. self-leadership, collaboration, and continuously learning and improving technical skills.
* [How "Engineering-driven" leads to "engineering-supremacy"](https://charity.wtf/2022/01/20/how-engineering-driven-leads-to-engineering-supremacy/)
    * Focusing on engineering as the key driver of a company's success can lead to negative outcomes as it can lead to neglecting the importance of other roles, such as product, sales, and customer support.
* [What Silicon Valley "Gets" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/)
  * In some companies engineering is not a feature factory. Engineers are expected to be creative problem solvers who also understand the business.
