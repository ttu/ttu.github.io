	<li>Rating site for MMA matches.</li>
	<li>Simple up / down rating.</li>
	<li>User recognition is now based on IP-address.</li>

	Web page
	<br/><br/>
	
	Try <a href="./MatchRate/index.html">development</a> version.<br/>
	<br/>
	
	<li>Web page shows all data ofn latest event and only names of the rest of the events. Clicking event's name, will get event's data with ajax.</li>
	<li>Windows Phone version shows all events in list and clicking event's name will switch to next view where event info is shown.</li>
	<li>PHP Web Site sends data to clients in JSON.</li>
	<li>Web page creates controls dynamically from JSON.</li>
	<li>Data is stored in MySQL database.</li>
	<li>Web site has checks that check request is made by human. (Should add CAPTCHA check)</li>

	Windows Phone application
	<br/><br/>
	
	<li>Windows Phone application creates Domail Models from JSON data (Web requests run on separate threads).</li>
	<li>Domain Models are converted to ViewModels. View Models use Commands, although Windows Phone doesn't support yet Command bindings.</li>
	<li>For now commands are binded to Tags and are executed from code-behind (I read from internet that MVVM Police won't take my family away, so it's ok like that).</li>
